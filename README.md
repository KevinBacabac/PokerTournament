# Poker Tournament Competition
Our goal is to make bots that compete in poker games using Python and game theory. You will be provided with sample code to customize as you wish.

## Learning Objectives

- Develop an understanding of intermediate Python. This includes variable scoping, classes, and various keywords (break, return, for-else, etc).

- Become comfortable using standard and non-standard libraries to produce a useful program.

## Tools and Technologies

[Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as the language of choice.

[Kivy](https://kivy.org/#download) to visualize the games. (It's entirely optional)
